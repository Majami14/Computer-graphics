 Computer Graphics ‚Äì Scene with a Penguin and Icebergs

This project was developed as a practical assignment for the **Computer Graphics** course. The application is implemented in **C++** using the **OpenGL** library and displays a 3D scene containing **two icebergs** and a **penguin** standing on one of them. The project demonstrates work with textures, lighting, animation, and an interactive camera.

 Scene Description

-  Two three-dimensional **icebergs**
-  A **penguin model** (manually added object) placed on one iceberg
-  **Textures** applied to objects for a realistic appearance
-  **Lighting** implemented in the scene
-  **Object rotation and animation** 
-  A **camera** that users can control to move and change the viewing angle

Technologies Used

- **C++**
- **OpenGL**
- **GLUT / FreeGLUT** (for windowing and input)
- **GLU** (for auxiliary graphics functions)
- Texturing and lighting in 3D space

 Running the Project

1. Open the project in a C++ environment (e.g., Visual Studio, Code::Blocks)
2. Make sure OpenGL and GLUT libraries are correctly linked
3. Compile and run the application

## üéØ Project Goal

The goal of this project was to practically apply both basic and advanced techniques in OpenGL ‚Äî including creating 3D objects, working with lighting and textures, animation, and interactive camera control.
